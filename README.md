# Lore Vault
A Chrome privacy extension for popular LLM providers. Currently supports ChatGPT (OpenAI) and Claude (Anthropic).

# A digital vault for your chat history. 
Lore Vault locks your sidebar history with a password, optional auto-lock timer, and a clean “vault overlay” that hides your chat titles until you unlock.

## Your patterns. Your secrets. Your vault.
Tired of minimizing your browser every time a coworker walks by? Lore Vault is a privacy extension designed for the power user. It places a sleek overlay over your ChatGPT sidebar, ensuring your chat titles and history remain invisible until you enter your custom access code.

**Why use Lore Vault?**

🏄 **The "Shoulder Surfer" Defense:** Hides sidebar history behind a full overlay while locked.

🔐 **Smart Auto-Lock:** Walked away for coffee? Locks automatically after inactivity (configurable timeout).

💎 **The Gem Lock:** A subtle 💎 button lets you lock instantly.

⌨️ **Hotkey Toggle:** **Ctrl + Shift + L** toggles Vault lock/unlock.

🚫 **Block “New Chat” Shortcuts (optional):** While locked, Lore Vault can intercept provider shortcuts (e.g. “new chat”) to prevent accidental chat creation.

👮 **Customizable Security:** Set your password, timeout, and options via the extension’s Options page.

🛡️ **Privacy Promise:** Lore Vault runs locally. It does not read or send your chat content anywhere. Your secrets are between you and your AI.

## Built for dreamers, coders, and anyone avoiding the Sky Police 🚨
